          Raku Ichijou, a first-year student at Bonyari High School, is the sole
          heir to an intimidating yakuza family. Ten years ago, Raku made a
          promise to his childhood friend. Now, all he has to go on is a pendant
          with a lock, which can only be unlocked with the key which the girl
          took with her when they parted.
          <br />
          <br />
          Now, years later, Raku has grown into a typical teenager, and all he
          wants is to remain as uninvolved in his yakuza background as possible
          while spending his school days alongside his middle school crush
          Kosaki Onodera. However, when the American Bee Hive Gang invades his
          family's turf, Raku's idyllic romantic dreams are sent for a toss as
          he is dragged into a frustrating conflict: Raku is to pretend that he
          is in a romantic relationship with Chitoge Kirisaki, the beautiful
          daughter of the Bee Hive's chief, so as to reduce the friction between
          the two groups. Unfortunately, reality could not be farther from this
          whopping lieâ€”Raku and Chitoge fall in hate at first sight, as the girl
          is convinced he is a pathetic pushover, and in Raku's eyes, Chitoge is
          about as attractive as a savage gorilla.
          <br />
          <br />
          Nisekoi follows the daily antics of this mismatched couple who have
          been forced to get along for the sake of maintaining the city's peace.
          With many more girls popping up his life, all involved with Raku's
          past somehow, his search for the girl who holds his heart and his
          promise leads him in more unexpected directions than he expects.
