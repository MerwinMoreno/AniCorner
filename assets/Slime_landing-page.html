        <hr />
        <p>
          Satoru Mikami is an ordinary 37-year-old corporate worker living in Tokyo. 
          He is almost content with his monotonous life, despite the fact that he doesn't have a girlfriend. 
          During a casual encounter with his colleague, an assailant pops out of nowhere and stabs him. 
          While succumbing to his injuries, a mysterious voice echoes in his mind and recites a series of 
          commands which he could not make sense of.
          <br />
          <br />

          After regaining consciousness, Satoru discovers that he has been reincarnated as a Slime in an 
          unfamiliar world. At the same time, he also acquires new-found skills, particularly the ability 
          called "Predator," which allows him to devour anything and mimic its appearance and skills. He 
          stumbles upon Veldora, a powerful 'Storm Dragon', who has been sealed for the last 300 years for 
          reducing a town to ashes. Feeling sorry for him, Satoru befriends the dragon, promising to help 
          him in destroying the seal. They decide to exchange names, Veldora bestows upon him name Rimuru, 
          and receives name Tempest in return. Slime then consumes the dragon together with his prison in 
          order to analyze the spell inside itself and eventually free Veldora.
          <br />
          <br />
          The disappearance of Veldora's aura creates a power vacuum which eventually makes Rimuru the
          leader of all beings inhabiting the Great Forest of Jura, who accept him as a ruler and together
          they found the nation of Tempest. With Rimuru's strength, wisdom and idealistic vision the new nation 
          quickly grows in strength and influence. Soon Rimuru and his subjects draw the attention of the nearby 
          foreign powers, from monarchs and legendary heroes to demon lords, some seeking to become their allies,
          while others intending to take advantage of or destroy them completely.
